# TDD Exercises in Java

TDD exercises taken from [TDD Manifesto](https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/).

The purpose of this repository is to serve as didactic example of the TDD process
(at least one possible solution) following the theoretical cycle as strictly as
possible.

Branches are organized by kata (FizzBuzz, String calculator, etc.) and commits
by requirements and TDD steps (red-green-refactor).

### Commit examples

#### First step: red test
```
FizzBuzz - Red: Added method signature

Added fizzBuzz() signature 
```

#### Second step: green test
```
FizzBuzz - Green: Added method signature

Added fizzBuzz() signature 
```

#### Third step: refactor (if apply)
```
FizzBuzz - Refactor: Added method signature

Added fizzBuzz() signature 
```
